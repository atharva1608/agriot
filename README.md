## Description
This project will help the farmers to know about their crop before cultivating onto the agricultural field and thus help them to make the appropriate decisions. It attempts to solve the issue by building a prototype of an interactive prediction system. The results of the prediction will be made available to the farmer. Thus, for such kind of data analytics in crop prediction, there are different techniques or algorithms, and with the help of those algorithms we can predict crops. Moreover this project help farmers in actual farming process by automatic watering system, providing security and local environmental conditions.   

* TRACKING FARMING USING QGIS: 
We aim to track agricultural production using QGIS , a geospatial software to track Rainfall , Temperature , Humidity , Location and other Crop parameters. We can also get location data which would help farmers to know what crops can be grown and in which area.

* CROP PREDICTION USING ML:
Based on parameters like SEASON,LOCATION,TEMPERATURE,RAINFALL , HUMIDITY, we will predict crops an help farmers to grow the crops which to gain maximum benefit and yield.

* AUTOMATIC WATERING:
Based on soil moisture content, automatically system will identify water deficient plant and water only that particular plant. It saves water.

* PLANT DISEASE DETECTION USING ML:
We aim to detect the plant disease detection and give recommendations for curing the plant of that disease.

* PROTECTION SYSTEM:
Our project provides security from natural disasters like unconditional rain or fire. As well as our project protect farm from animals and birds.

* PRECAUTIONS NEEDED FOR SOWING SEEDS:
User needs to see precautions while sowing the seeds.

* WEATHER FORECASTING:
We are able to detect the weather forecast of the location of the plant to monitor its health.

## Project Setup
Can use our website link directly by clicking on the given link https://smart-ml-and-iot-based-agriculture-project.on.drv.tw/agrox3_final/web/

## Usage
Once you go on the website link that is given you can use multiple features of our website
1. We have successfully implemented a crop prediction system with a qgis software for farmers to predict crops and get adequate details regarding it.
2. We have also implemented a plant disease detection webpage which helps farmers to detect diseases and give cure for it.
3. We have provided weather forecasting feature to manage the schedule of farming activities and minimal wastage of crop due to unconditional changes in the weather.
4. We have successfully designed smart watering system which can water to plants automatically and as per requirement only, which saves lot of water.
5. This project can provide security to the farm from animals, birds as well as from natural dangers like fire, unconditional rain.
6. We also have added a precision agriculture feature which gives us information about common diseases in plants prior to sowing it.

## Applications
1. The impact of climate change in India, most of the agricultural crops are being badly affected. Predicting the crop in advance of its production would help farmers for taking appropriate measures for marketing and storage. Implementation of such a system with an easy-to-use web based graphic user interface and the machine learning algorithm will be carried out. The results of the prediction will be made available to the farmer.
2. Overwatering decreases fertility of the soil as well so it is very important to use water in appropriate quantity. Watering is the key in region of scarcity of water. Due to unpredictable climate conditions large quantity of crops get affected every year. So, by understanding local surrounding data farmers can save their crops. 
3. Some animals or birds can also cause damage to crop hence secure farm from them is also important task. So by finding solution to all these problems we farmers can get maximum benefit in terms of efforts as well as cost. 


## Future scope
1. Our future scope is to add a login system for farmers as well customers , where we plan to implement buying and selling of farming produce.
2. We also plan to implement a feature where in farmers and can buy and sell farming equipment like seeds , fertilizers , pesticides, weeder blade etc.
